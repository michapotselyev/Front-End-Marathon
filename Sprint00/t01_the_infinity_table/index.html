                        According to Wong's ancient texts, the Soul Stone could prove to be the greatest threat 
                        out of all the Infinity Stones. Gamora knew of the location of the Soul Stone from a 
                        map she found to its whereabouts (which she burnt) but kept this a secret from Thanos. 
                        Once captured and interrogated by her father, whom tortured Gamora's sister Nebula, he 
                        took her to its holding place on Vormir, where Red Skull, the Soul Stone's guardian, told 
                        them that it could only be accessed after a personal cost was paid - namely, the 
                        sacrifice of a loved one, to ensure that the owner understood its power. Thanos then 
                        tearfully sacrificed his daughter and later woke up with the Soul Stone in his hand, 
                        adding it to the Infinity Gauntlet shortly thereafter before heading off to retrieve the 
                        Time and Mind Stones.

                        The Eye of Agamotto is an ancient artifact, a pendant created by Agamotto, the first
                        Sorcerer Supreme, presumably to contain and harness the power of the green Time Stone
                        contained inside. After being stored for an unknown amount of time on a pedestal in
                        Kamar-Taj, it was recently wielded by Doctor Stephen Strange, first to aid him in his
                        learning of sorcery, then in his final fight against Kaecilius and Dormammu. When
                        wielded by someone having the necessary knowledge and skills, it appeared to be able
                        to control the flow of time, be it on a small or massive scale, notably to turn
                        back something to a previous state, to accelerate its time in order to apply changes 
                        that have not happened yet, or to lock it in a time loop, resetting its state until the 
                        wielder stops its effect. It appeared skilled sorcerers, or perhaps users of powers from 
                        the Dark Dimension could to an extent subtract themselves to the effects of the stone, 
                        stopping the time-reversal affecting oneself or detecting one was stuck in a time loop. 
                        It was noted by Wong and Karl Mordo that the use of the Eye was contrary to the natural 
                        order of things and extremely dangerous. With Wong's approval, it was placed back on its 
                        pedestal by Strange until he learned how to properly harness its powers. Strange wore it 
                        once again a little while later while meeting with Thor and Loki. Strange was forced to 
                        later surrender the Stone to Thanos in order to save Tony Stark's life.

                        The Tesseract is named for its cube-like appearance and is capable of controlling space
                        itself, providing the user instant access to any location throughout the universe if used 
                        correctly. The unique element that composes the Tesseract has also been used to create 
                        advanced weaponry by races like the Humans. This stone played an important role in 
                        humanity's development during the dawn of the superhero age, attracting the attention 
                        of forces such as Red Skull and Thanos, both of whom sought to use the Tesseract's power 
                        for their own sinister intents. It is later revealed that the cube is a containment unit 
                        built around the actual Infinity Stone so that it could be somewhat safely handled and 
                        controlled. Despite such protection, touching the Tesseract barehanded can still have dire 
                        consequences as seen with Red Skull. However, it was later hinted that the Space Stone 
                        punished Red Skull for abusing its power for his own gain, suggesting at least some of 
                        the Infinity Stones can be touched directly by ordinary beings if they are deemed worthy. 
                        In Thor's vision, the Tesseract is shattered to unveil the blue Space Stone contained 
                        inside it. Thanos later acquired the Tesseract from Loki, who had saved it from Asgard's 
                        destruction. With only his bare hand, Thanos crushed the Tesseract and extracted the Space 
                        Stone within before he inserted it into the Infinity Gauntlet. In an alternate timeline, 
                        during the Time Heist on 2012, Loki picked up the Tesseract and used it to escape from 
                        S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers.

                        The Scepter was a weapon that utilized the yellow Mind Stone housed inside a blue computer 
                        module, which also masked the stone's presence. Stark originally saw the Stone as a power 
                        source, whereas once J.A.R.V.I.S. had the opportunity to study the stone he stated it was 
                        more akin to a very powerful computer. The stone within had already been in the possession 
                        of Thanos when he gave it to Loki to aid him in his invasion of Earth. It grants to the 
                        user powerful mental abilities, like the power to subjugate the minds of others, bending 
                        them to the will of the user, as well as project the user's consciousness to a higher plane 
                        of existence. The stone was also said to greatly increase the intelligence of those 
                        capable of wielding it, as shown in the cases of Loki and Wolfgang von Strucker. When Loki 
                        failed in his campaign, the Scepter fell into the possession of S.H.I.E.L.D., eventually 
                        being passed on to HYDRA via sleeper agents. The Scepter was then used in various HYDRA 
                        experiments, notably inducing superhuman powers in young Sokovian twins Wanda and Pietro 
                        Maximoff, and other capabilities such as mind control, astral and energy projection were 
                        unearthed as well as telepathic and telekinetic powers. The protective casing of the 
                        Scepter's gem was eventually broken by Ultron and the contained stone was used to bring 
                        life to Vision. Thor later entrusted the stone to Vision, stating that Vision was worthy 
                        and that safety was hard to come by nowadays. Despite being a part of him, the stone's 
                        origin was a mystery for Vision and he wished to understand it so he could control it. 
                        The Mind Stone was the last stone Thanos would acquire, which he forcibly removed from 
                        Vision, killing him.

                        The Aether appears as a dark, red, viscous liquid. It acts as a symbiotic force, capable 
                        of being absorbed into the body of a living host, giving the user the ability to warp 
                        reality at will, granting that person immense strength, durability, powers, and 
                        subjective influence over the universe. Malekith planned to use the Aether's 
                        reality-bending abilities to cover all Nine Realms in darkness; however, he was 
                        stopped by the combined efforts of Thor and Jane Foster. Only two people, Jane Foster 
                        and Malekith, are known to have been hosts for the Aether, but circumstances prevented 
                        the full extent of the Aether's potential from being explored. It is later shown that the 
                        Aether is actually an Infinity Stone contained in a liquid form, and in Thor's vision, 
                        this liquid solidifies into the red Reality Stone. The Aether is given to The Collector 
                        by Thor's companions, Sif and Volstagg and later seized by Thanos, who solidified it into 
                        the Reality Stone and inserted it into his Infinity Gauntlet.

                        The Power Stone is an incredible power source, it increases the user's physical abilities 
                        and allows it to manipulate energy, which, when used at full potential, has enough power 
                        to obliterate an entire planet when unleashed. This stone was sought by Thanos, who tasked 
                        Ronan the Accuser to acquire it from the dead planet of Morag, in exchange for destroying 
                        Xandar. However, Star-Lord acquired the stone first and was prepared to sell it to 
                        Taneleer Tivan ("The Collector") with Gamora until its destructive power was unleashed at 
                        Knowhere. Soon after, Ronan obtained it and harnessed its energy with the intent of 
                        destroying all life on Xandar and killing Thanos. Star-Lord and the Guardians of the 
                        Galaxy were able to take the stone from Ronan and collectively harness its power to 
                        destroy him. They then gave the stone to Nova Prime Irani Rael for safekeeping on Xandar. 
                        However, Thanos would wipe out the Nova Corps in a successful attempt to acquire the Power 
                        Stone and he then inserts it into his Infinity Gauntlet.
